        <h3>Gilded Crown</h3>
        <p>Author:MARIANNE GORDON</p>
        <p>Genre:SCIENCE FICTION & FANTASY</p>
        <p><h4>A richly imagined beginning that should not be missed.</p></h4>
        <p>A young woman is dragged from her quiet country life into the vicious, backstabbing world of politics and religion in this fantasy series opener.<br>

            Hellevir has always been different. When she was 10, she discovered the ability to travel into Death, the strange, liminal world ruled by a mysterious man in black. When she is 12, and her mother dies in childbirth, Hellevir travels to Death and offers the man in black a trade: If Hellevir gives up “something from life that is full of life” and a “blood gift” (in this case, one of her fingers), she will be able to return her mother to the world of the living.<br> 
            Milandre, an old healer and Hellevir’s mentor, warns Hellevir to keep her gifts a secret. But when the queen brings her poisoned granddaughter’s corpse to Milandre’s doorstep, Hellevir can’t stop herself from bringing the young woman, Sullivain, back to life. Soon afterward, Hellevir receives a royal summons to move to the city and be ready to bring Sullivain back from the dead at a moment’s notice.<br> 
            Only the man in black isn’t happy with Hellevir defying the laws of nature, and he requests a new kind of price if she wants to bring back any more lost souls without losing even more of herself. Gordon’s fantastic series opener paints the world of Rochidain with vivid detail, from its network of canals to the drunken parties of its nobles to the sinister state religion that has a strong hold on Hellevir’s mother. Hellevir’s complicated relationship with Sullivain, whose gratitude and attachment to Hellevir don’t stop her from threatening Hellevir’s family should she let Sullivain die, has more than enough substance to sustain the books to come.<br>

        <h3>Dog Day Afternoon</h3>
        <p>Author:David Rosenfelt</p>
        <p>Genre:MYSTERY & DETECTIVE</p>
        <p><h4>Solid legal thrills from a master of the light touch. And the dog you’d forgotten about turns up to brighten the final scene.</p></h4>
        <p>A favor for his friend and associate Marcus Clark lands Paterson, New Jersey, attorney Andy Carpenter back in the courtroom for another impossible defense.<br>

            A man shows up at the offices of Moore Law and uses six bullets to kill six people, leaving only attorney Sally Montrose and paralegal Laura Schauble alive to identify him from his tattoo and distinctive footgear as handyman Nick Williams.<br> 
            Even a tyro would realize that the murders are the work of a professional hit man, but lead prosecutor Richard Wallace is no tyro, and when the cops find the murder weapon in a trash bin a few blocks from Nick’s home with Nick’s fingerprint on it, he seems done for. Along the way, though, Marcus, who’s served as an informal mentor to Nick and his friend Rafe Duran, asks Andy to defend him. Much as he hates the practice of law, Andy can’t say no to Marcus, and he’s soon gathering evidence that will link the six killings—more will follow, since Andy has a habit of warning suspicious characters that they have only a day or so to fess up before he turns them in—to a complex series of insurance frauds whose basis turns out to be beautifully simple.<br>
            Andy jokes less than usual (a definite minus), presumably because the evidence against his client is overwhelming, but the international intrigue behind so many of his recent cases is mercifully absent here (a definite plus).</p>

        <h3>Deep water</h3>
        <p>Author:JAMES BRADLEY</p>
        <p>Genre:Non Fiction</p>
        <p><h4>A satisfying tribute to the wonders of the ocean and the myriad dangers it faces.</p></h4>
        <p>A novelist, activist, and naturalist writes a paean to the sea.<br>

            Bradley, editor of The Penguin Book of the Ocean, reminds readers that we live on a planet whose surface is mostly water. “We spend the first nine months of our lives suspended in the liquid of the womb; once we emerge our tissues are made of water, our blood salt as the sea,” he writes.<br>
            With a nod to Rachel Carson, who also wrote about “the ocean’s mysteries” and “the way its meanings haunt and elude us,” Bradley brings the science up to date with the latest findings of oceanographers and biologists. He begins with a history of the Earth; soon after the planet cooled, water appeared.<br>
            Bradley delivers a vivid, expert education on the ocean’s makeup and behavior, including valuable information on currents, tides, sea creatures, reefs, glaciers and sea ice, abyssal depths (amazingly rich in life), beaches, and resource extraction, with an emphasis on the heavy hand of human exploitation. In the 20th century, scientists mourned species extinction and disappearing forests, but the current century’s onslaught of climate change, massive chemical and plastic pollution, and technology that literally vacuums up life from the ocean and ores from its floor means that many modern natural histories—Bradley’s included—deliver as much pain as pleasure.<br>
            Human cultures barely disturbed the ocean until technology from Western Europe exploded across the world after the Middle Ages, followed by the industrial revolution. While historians do not ignore the despicable international slave trade, colonialism, and racism that followed, Bradley devotes more space than the average natural historian. His warnings about the mass human disaster already in progress, including continued warming and rising sea levels, are more focused, though equally disturbing.</p>
